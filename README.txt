OPTIONSET
---------

Optionset module creates a field that exposes checkboxes in the widget, but stores the results in a single text field, pipe-separated.

Very handy for the cases where you want to allow user to select from a set of options, but don't want to store each checkbox result as a separate database field entry.

Installation and configuration
==============================

1. Install as any other Drupal module.
2. Add an Optionset type field to the desired entity, and provide allowed options.
3. Provide default values if needed.
